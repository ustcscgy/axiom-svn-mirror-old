This experimental branch maintained by Waldek Hebisch.

Current goals:

-- generate all information that can be generated (documentation,
   images, databases)
-- remove unused code (both old and new but unfinished)
-- rework file handling (current code is buggy, complicated and
   inefficient)
-- improve SPAD compiler
