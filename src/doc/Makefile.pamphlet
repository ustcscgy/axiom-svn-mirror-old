\section{The bibtex stanza}
Axiom pamphlet files have citations. We collect all of the 
pamphlet file citations into this one file so we have a standard
place and format for bibliographic references.

Citations of pamphlet files which are local are generally by
the name. For example, [[asq.c.pamphlet]] would be cited using
[[\cite{asq.c}]].
<<bibtex>>=
${MID}/axiom.bib: ${IN}/axiom.bib.pamphlet
	@echo 1 making ${MID}/axiom.bib from ${IN}/axiom.bib.pamphlet
	@ (cd ${MID} ; \
	 ${TANGLE} ${IN}/axiom.bib.pamphlet >${MID}/axiom.bib )

@ 
\section{The axiom.sty stanza}
Axiom uses a style file that is a modified version of the noweb.sty
originally written by Norman Ramsey. To this we've added macros to
support the CATS (Computer Algebra Test Suite).
<<axiom.sty>>=
${STY}/axiom.sty: ${IN}/axiom.sty.pamphlet
	@echo 2 making ${STY}/axiom.sty from ${IN}/axiom.sty.pamphlet
	@(cd ${STY} ; \
	${TANGLE} -R"axiom.sty" ${IN}/axiom.sty.pamphlet >axiom.sty )

@ 
\section{The Reference Card}
This is the one-page, 2 sided reference card
<<refcard>>=
${DVI}/refcard.dvi: ${IN}/refcard.pamphlet
	@echo 4 making ${DVI}/refcard.dvi from ${IN}/refcard.pamphlet
	@(cd ${MID} ; \
	cp ${IN}/refcard.pamphlet ${MID} ;\
	${DOCUMENT} ${NOISE} refcard ; \
	cp refcard.dvi ${DVI} )

@
\section{The End Papers}
This document reproduces the diagrams on the inside covers of the
original Jenks Axiom book but adds hyperlinks.
<<Endpapers>>=
${DVI}/endpaper.dvi: ${IN}/endpaper.pamphlet
	@echo 4 making ${DVI}/endpaper.dvi from ${IN}/endpaper.pamphlet
	@(cd ${MID} ; \
	cp ${IN}/endpaper.pamphlet ${MID} ; \
	mkdir -p ${MID}/ps ; \
	cp ${IN}/ps/*ps* ${MID}/ps ; \
	${DOCUMENT} ${NOISE} endpaper ; \
	cp endpaper.dvi ${DVI} ; \
	mkdir -p ${DVI}/ps ; \
	cp ${IN}/ps/*ps* ${DVI}/ps )

\section{rosetta}
The rosetta document is an effort to give a command-by-command
way of moving between various computer algebra systems. It was
originally created for the "rosetta" series of CDs. These rosetta
CDs contained multiple, free computer algebra systems.
<<rosetta>>=
${DVI}/rosetta.dvi: ${IN}/rosetta.pamphlet
	@echo 5 building ${DVI}/rosetta.dvi from ${IN}/rosetta.pamphlet
	@(cd ${MID} ; \
	cp ${IN}/rosetta.pamphlet ${MID} ; \
	${DOCUMENT} ${NOISE} rosetta ; \
	cp rosetta.dvi ${DVI} )

@
\section{The booklet command}
<<booklet>>=
${OUT}/booklet: ${MID}/booklet.o
	@echo 6 making ${OUT}/booklet from ${MID}/booklet.o
	@(cd ${OUT} ; \
	  ${CC} ${MID}/booklet.o -o booklet )

${MID}/booklet.o: ${INT}/booklet.c
	@echo 7 making ${MID}/booklet.o from ${INT}/booklet.c
	@(cd ${MID} ; \
	  ${CC} -c ${INT}/booklet.c )

${INT}/booklet.c: ${IN}/booklet.c.pamphlet
	@echo 8 making ${INT}/booklet.c from ${IN}/booklet.c.pamphlet
	@(cd ${INT} ; \
	  ${TANGLE} ${IN}/booklet.c.pamphlet >booklet.c )

\section{The Makefile}
We need to document the commands.
