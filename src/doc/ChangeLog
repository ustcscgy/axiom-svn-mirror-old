	* bookvol1.pamphlet: Removed conflicting explicit
	definitions of \spadgraph and \spadfunFrom since they are already
	defined in exactly the same way in src/doc/axiom.sty.pamplet.

	* Makefile.pamplet: There is no need to copy src/doc/ps
	recursively to either int/doc or ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc since the ps
	directory does not contain subdirectories. Avoiding the recursive
	copy avoids to copy a .svn directory from a subversion working
	copy.
	
	* Makefile.pamplet: The 'if' for [[${NOISE}]] was wrong.
	It used to redirect the output to ${tmp}/trace if [[${NOISE}]] was
	empty.
