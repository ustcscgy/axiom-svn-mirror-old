  <h1> Why Literate Programming?</h1>

Once a program has been developed and the developers have moved
on to other tasks it needs to be maintained. The fundamental problem
is that if you modify code you didn't write, you don't see the big
picture and you don't understand the reasons why the code is written
the way it is. Thus changing code without a larger context is almost
always going to introduce new bugs.
</p>
<p>
The only way to correctly change code is to deeply understand the
implications of the change. This requires a deep understanding of
the code and an awareness of the big picture. Yet the "why" of code
is rarely ever written down in standard programming practice.
The goal is only to elaborate the "how" so the machine can perform
the task. The programmer communicates with the machine.
</p>
<p>
Literate programming, as used in Axiom, is an attempt to communicate
with other users, developers, and researchers in addition to the
machine. The goal is to have the program read like a story so that
others can understand the rational, the theory, the choices, the
implications, and the implementation context as well as the "how".
</p>
<p>
This code is intended to live forever but it is highly probable
that you will not. Write to communicate with the next person to
pick up the torch. When you explore code, write down what you learn.
When you change code, explain why you made your choices. When you 
write new code explain what others need to know to maintain it.
</p>


  <h1> User documentation</h1>

The Axiom system is gradually being documented in a set of volumes.
These change with every update to the system since they contain the
actual system source code. The volumes listed here are updated every
other month when the system is distributed. The current volume set is:
<ul>
 <li>
  <a href="toc.pdf">Combined Table of Contents</a>
 </li>
 This is the table of contents from the existing volumes
 combined into one document for easy reference.
 <br/>
 <li>
  <a href="bookvol0.pdf">Volume 0: Axiom Jenks and Sutor</a>
 </li>
 This is the reconstructed Jenks and Sutor volume.
 <br/>
 <li>
  <a href="bookvol1.pdf">Volume 1: Axiom Tutorial</a>
 </li>
 This is the tutorial volume ISBN 1-411-66587-X.
 Hardcopy is available from Amazon.com or Lulu.com
 <br/>

 This covers the axiom commands, sman, and some other system
 related issues.
 <br/>
 <li>
  <a href="bookvol7.pdf">Volume 7: Axiom Hyperdoc</a>

 </li>
 This is the source code for all of the categories.
 <li>
  <a href="bookvol10.3.pdf">Volume 10.3: Axiom Algebra Domains</a>
 </li>
 This is the source code for all of the domains.
 <li>
  <a href="bookvol10.4.pdf">Volume 10.4: Axiom Algebra Packages</a>
 </li>
 This is the source code for all of the packages.
 </ul>
 <li>
  <a href="bookvol11.pdf">Volume 11: Axiom Browser</a>
 </li>

 front end.
 <br/>
 <li>
  <a href="bookvol12.pdf">Volume 12: Axiom Crystal</a>
 </li>
 This is the design documents and internals for the crystal interface.
 <br/>
</ul>
  
  <p>
  Axiom is being reworked to use the Firefox browser as the new
  front end. <a href="hyperdoc/rootpage.xhtml">Static pages</a>
  from the new hyperdoc show some of the details. These pages 
  will be "live" in the new Axiom hyperdoc.

  <p>
  The <a href="dotabb.html">algebra graph</a> in its current form is 
  available. You'll need a reasonably new browser to see the graph.
  This is a work in progress.

  <p>
  A first tutorial is available at: <a
