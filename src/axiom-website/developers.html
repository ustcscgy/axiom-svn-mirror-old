  <h1>Axiom Development</h1>

Axiom development is now hosted on an Arch server 
running on axiom.developer.org.
<br>
<br>
There is an irc channel where developers can find other developers. It is:
<br>
server: irc.freenode.net 
<br>
channel:#axiom-developer
<br>
<br>
You only need to do these setup steps once.
In order to access the arch sources you need to let arch know who
you are with the command:
<br>
<pre>
  tla my-id "First Last &lt;addy@host.com&gt;"
</pre>
<br>
Next you need to register an archive:
<br>
<pre>
  tla register-archive arch@axiom-developer.org--axiom http://axiom-developer.org/archive/axiom
</pre>
<br>
Then set up a default archive
<br>
<pre>
  tla my-default-archive arch@axiom-developer.org--axiom
</pre>
<br>
<hr>
In order to get the latest source for the Axiom main line type:
<br>
<pre>
  tla get axiom--main--1
</pre>
<br>
<hr>
There are several branches available. Each branch is used to develop
a particular idea and get a stable, working version before merging
it back to the main line. The currently available branches are:
<br>
<pre>
axiom--main--1       the main development branch
     this branch will be mirrored to the CVS on savannah when it
     is stable and tested. 
     Currently in <a href="devel.html">step 4</a> of development.

axiom--hyperdoc--1   development of hyperdoc
     NOTE: This branch has been merged and is now dead.
     this branch contains code for building hyperdoc. 

axiom--BSD--1        port to BSD
     work with Mark Murray &lt;mark at grondar.org&gt;
     Currently in <a href="devel.html">step 1</a> of development.

axiom--MACOSX--1     port to MACOSX
     work with Chuck Miller &lt;cfm at ms.unimelb.edu.au&gt;
     Currently in <a href="devel.html">step 1</a> of development.

book--main--1        axiom book
     work with community to clean up the book for printing
     Currently in <a href="devel.html">step 1</a> of development.

axiom--solaris--1    port to solaris
     work with Kostas Oikonomou &lt;ko at research.att.com&gt;
     Currently in <a href="devel.html">step 1</a> of development.

axiom--graphics--1   finish graphics integration
     NOTE: This branch has been merged and is now dead.
     work on integration, testing of graphics.

axiom--windows--1    port to windows
     work with &lt; Mike Thomas &lt;mike.thomas at brisbane.paradigmgeo.com&gt;
     Currently in <a href="devel.html">step 1</a> of development.

axiom--language--1   explore axiom language modifications
     work with Stephen Wilson &lt;wilsons at multiboard.com&gt;
     Currently in <a href="devel.html">step 1</a> of development.

axiom--sbcl--1       port axiom to steel bank common lisp
     work with Tim Daly Jr. &lt;tim at tenkan.org&gt; and
               Nate Daly &lt;nate at tenkan.org&gt;
     Currently in <a href="devel.html">step 1</a> of development.

zlc--main--1        add a zero learning curve interface to axiom
     work with Jinzhong Niu &lt;jniu at gc.cuny.edu&gt;
               Xaiowei Xu &lt;xuxw at yahoo.com&gt;
     Currently in <a href="devel.html">step 1</a> of development.

axiom--algebra--1    prototype algebra code
     Currently in <a href="devel.html">step 1</a> of development.

axiom--GUI--1    portable GUI interface

If you need write access to the archive you need to follow these steps:
<br>
Create a key by typing:
<br>
<pre>
ssh-keygen -t dsa
</pre>
This will create a file called .ssh/id_dsa.pub. You need to send the
contents of this file to Tim Daly &lt;daly@idsi.net&gt; 
so your interactions can be enabled.
<br>
In order to access the arch sources you need to let arch know who
you are with the command:
<br>
<pre>
  tla my-id "First Last &lt;addy@host.com&gt;"
</pre>
<br>
Next you need to register an archive:
<br>
<pre>
  tla register-archive arch@axiom-developer.org--axiom sftp://arch@axiom-developer.org/home/arch/archive/axiom
</pre>
Notice that you're using sftp rather than http. The sftp function
uses the secure keys to enable ftp access to the sources. The http
function is read-only.
<br>
Then set up a default archive
<br>
<pre>
  tla my-default-archive arch@axiom-developer.org--axiom
</pre>
<br>
<hr>
In order to get the latest source for the Axiom main line type:
<br>
<pre>
  tla get axiom--main--1
</pre>
<br>
Now you can change the sources. Once you've made changes they need
to be sent back (commit) to the host. In order to do the commit 
function in tla you need a log file that summarizes the changes.
You can create and edit the log file with:
<br>
<pre>
  emacs -nw `tla make-log`
</pre>
<br>
or for the vi fans
<pre>
  vi `tla make-log`
</pre>
Finally you commit the changes with:
<br>
<pre>
  tla commit
</pre>
