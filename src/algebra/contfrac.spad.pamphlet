++ Description: \spadtype{NumericContinuedFraction} provides functions
++   for converting floating point numbers to continued fractions.

NumericContinuedFraction(F): Exports == Implementation where
  F :     FloatingPointSystem
  CFC ==> ContinuedFraction Integer
  I   ==> Integer
  ST  ==> Stream I

  Exports ==> with
    continuedFraction: F -> CFC
      ++ continuedFraction(f) converts the floating point number
      ++ \spad{f} to a reduced continued fraction.

  Implementation ==> add

    cfc: F -> ST
    cfc(a) == delay
      aa := wholePart a
      zero?(b := a - (aa :: F)) => concat(aa,empty()$ST)
      concat(aa,cfc inv b)

    continuedFraction a ==
      aa := wholePart a
      zero?(b := a - (aa :: F)) =>
        reducedContinuedFraction(aa,empty()$ST) 
      if negative? b then (aa := aa - 1; b := b + 1)
      reducedContinuedFraction(aa,cfc inv b)
