++ Description:
++  MonoidRingFunctions2 implements functions between
++  two monoid rings defined with the same monoid over different rings.
MonoidRingFunctions2(R,S,M) : Exports == Implementation where
    R  : Ring
    S  : Ring
    M  : Monoid
    Exports ==> with
      map: (R -> S, MonoidRing(R,M)) -> MonoidRing(S,M)
        ++ map(f,u) maps f onto the coefficients f the element
        ++ u of the monoid ring to create an element of a monoid
        ++ ring with the same monoid b.
    Implementation ==> add
      map(fn, u) ==
        res : MonoidRing(S,M) := 0
        for te in terms u repeat
          res := res + monomial(fn(te.coef), te.monom)
        res
