++ Description:
++   \spadtype{ScriptFormulaFormat1} provides a utility coercion for
++   changing to SCRIPT formula format anything that has a coercion to
++   the standard output format.

ScriptFormulaFormat1(S : SetCategory): public == private where
  public  ==  with
    coerce: S -> ScriptFormulaFormat()
      ++ coerce(s) provides a direct coercion from an expression s of domain S to
      ++ SCRIPT formula format. This allows the user to skip the step of
      ++ first manually coercing the object to standard output format
      ++ before it is coerced to SCRIPT formula format.

  private == add
    import ScriptFormulaFormat()

    coerce(s : S): ScriptFormulaFormat ==
      coerce(s :: OutputForm)$ScriptFormulaFormat
