++   This package allows one to apply a function to the coefficients of
++   a univariate Taylor series.
UnivariateTaylorSeriesFunctions2(Coef1,Coef2,UTS1,UTS2):_
 Exports == Implementation where
  Coef1 : Ring
  Coef2 : Ring
  UTS1  : UnivariateTaylorSeriesCategory Coef1
  UTS2  : UnivariateTaylorSeriesCategory Coef2
  ST2 ==> StreamFunctions2(Coef1,Coef2)

  Exports ==> with
    map: (Coef1 -> Coef2,UTS1) -> UTS2
      ++\spad{map(f,g(x))} applies the map f to the coefficients of
      ++ the Taylor series \spad{g(x)}.

  Implementation ==> add

    map(f,uts) == series map(f,coefficients uts)$ST2
