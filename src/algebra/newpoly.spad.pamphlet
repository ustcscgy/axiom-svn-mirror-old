++ Description:
++ This package lifts a mapping from coefficient rings R to S to
++ a mapping from sparse univariate polynomial over R to
++ a sparse univariate polynomial over S.
++ Note that the mapping is assumed
++ to send zero to zero, since it will only be applied to the non-zero
++ coefficients of the polynomial.

NewSparseUnivariatePolynomialFunctions2(R:Ring, S:Ring): with
  map:(R->S,NewSparseUnivariatePolynomial R) -> NewSparseUnivariatePolynomial S
    ++ \axiom{map(func, poly)} creates a new polynomial by applying func to
    ++ every non-zero coefficient of the polynomial poly.
