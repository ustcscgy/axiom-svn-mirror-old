++   This package provides tools for creating radix expansions.
RadixUtilities: Exports == Implementation where
  Exports ==> with
    radix: (Fraction Integer,Integer) -> Any
      ++ radix(x,b) converts x to a radix expansion in base b.
  Implementation ==> add
    radix(q, b) ==
      coerce(q :: RadixExpansion(b))$AnyFunctions1(RadixExpansion b)
