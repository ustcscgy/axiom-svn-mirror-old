++ Author : Larry Lambe
++ Date Created : August  1988
++ Date Last Updated : March 9 1990
++ Related Constructors: OrderedSetInts, Commutator, FreeNilpotentLie
++ AMS Classification: Primary 17B05, 17B30; Secondary 17A50
++ Keywords: free Lie algebra, Hall basis, basic commutators
++ Description : Generate a basis for the free Lie algebra on n
++ generators over a ring R with identity up to basic commutators
++ of length c using the algorithm of P. Hall as given in Serre's
++ book Lie Groups -- Lie Algebras

HallBasis() : Export == Implement where
   B   ==> Boolean
   I   ==> Integer
   NNI ==> NonNegativeInteger
   VI  ==> Vector Integer
   VLI ==> Vector List Integer

   Export  ==> with
     lfunc : (I,I) -> I
       ++ lfunc(d,n) computes the rank of the nth factor in the
       ++ lower central series of the free d-generated free Lie
       ++ algebra;  This rank is d if n = 1 and binom(d,2) if
       ++ n = 2
     inHallBasis? : (I,I,I,I) -> B
       ++ inHallBasis?(numberOfGens, leftCandidate, rightCandidate, left)
       ++ tests to see if a new element should be added to the P. Hall
       ++ basis being constructed.
       ++ The list \spad{[leftCandidate,wt,rightCandidate]}
       ++ is included in the basis if in the unique factorization of
       ++ rightCandidate, we have left factor leftOfRight, and
       ++ leftOfRight <= leftCandidate
     generate : (NNI,NNI) -> VLI
       ++ generate(numberOfGens, maximalWeight) generates a vector of
       ++ elements of the form [left,weight,right] which represents a
       ++ P. Hall basis element for the free lie algebra on numberOfGens
       ++ generators.  We only generate those basis elements of weight
       ++ less than or equal to maximalWeight
