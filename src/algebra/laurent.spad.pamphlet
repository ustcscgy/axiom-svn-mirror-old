++ Description: Mapping package for univariate Laurent series
++   This package allows one to apply a function to the coefficients of
++   a univariate Laurent series.
UnivariateLaurentSeriesFunctions2(Coef1,Coef2,var1,var2,cen1,cen2):_
 Exports == Implementation where
  Coef1 : Ring
  Coef2 : Ring
  var1: Symbol
  var2: Symbol
  cen1: Coef1
  cen2: Coef2
  ULS1  ==> UnivariateLaurentSeries(Coef1, var1, cen1)
  ULS2  ==> UnivariateLaurentSeries(Coef2, var2, cen2)
  UTS1  ==> UnivariateTaylorSeries(Coef1, var1, cen1)
  UTS2  ==> UnivariateTaylorSeries(Coef2, var2, cen2)
  UTSF2 ==> UnivariateTaylorSeriesFunctions2(Coef1, Coef2, UTS1, UTS2)

  Exports ==> with
    map: (Coef1 -> Coef2,ULS1) -> ULS2
      ++ \spad{map(f,g(x))} applies the map f to the coefficients of the Laurent
      ++ series \spad{g(x)}.

  Implementation ==> add

    map(f,ups) == laurent(degree ups, map(f, taylorRep ups)$UTSF2)
