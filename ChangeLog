	* Makefile.pamphlet, src/scripts/Makefile.pamphlet,
	src/doc/Makefile.pamphlet: After checking out the trunk of Axiom
	Silver, a 'make' did not succeed because the src/script directory
	was copied twice. Since the .svn directory inside contains
	write-protected files, it caused problems.

	Quote from Makefile.pamplet:

	Since this is the first build message that gets generated
	we echo the ENV variable for debugging purposes. We use the
	specific file[[${MNT}/${SYS}/bin/Makefile.pamphlet]] as the
	trigger to prevent duplicate execution of this stanza.

	That is now also used in src/scripts/Makefile.pamphlet.
