	* Makefile.pamphlet, src/scripts/Makefile.pamphlet,
	src/doc/Makefile.pamphlet: After checking out the trunk of Axiom
	Silver, a 'make' did not succeed because the src/script directory
	was copied twice. Since the .svn directory inside contains
	write-protected files, it caused problems.

	Quote from Makefile.pamplet:

	Since this is the first build message that gets generated
	we echo the ENV variable for debugging purposes. We use the
	specific file[[${MNT}/${SYS}/bin/Makefile.pamphlet]] as the
	trigger to prevent duplicate execution of this stanza.

	That is now also used in src/scripts/Makefile.pamphlet.

	* src/doc/Makefile.pamplet: There is no need to copy src/doc/ps
	recursively to either int/doc or ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc since the ps
	directory does not contain subdirectories. Avoiding the recursive
	copy avoids to copy a .svn directory from a subversion working
	copy.
	
	* src/doc/Makefile.pamplet: The 'if' for [[${NOISE}]] was wrong.
	It used to redirect the output to ${tmp}/trace if [[${NOISE}]] was
	empty.

	* src/doc/bookvol1.pamphlet: Removed conflicting explicit
	definitions of \spadgraph and \spadfunFrom since they are already
	defined in exactly the same way in src/doc/axiom.sty.pamplet.
