In order to reduce the size of the runtime package, and not increase the size
of the -dev package. I have decided to provide all documentation in a separate
-doc package. As this libgmp3-doc package is not referenced by dependency in
the other packages, this README is to inform you of its existence.

If you need the info files for gmp, or the additional docs and demos, please
install the latest libgmp3-doc package.

Luck,

Dwarf
