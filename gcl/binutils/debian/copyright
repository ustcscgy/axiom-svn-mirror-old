This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU assembler,
linker, and binary utilities.

This package was put together by me, James Troup <james@nocrew.org>,
from sources, which I obtained from:

  ftp://ftp.uk.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/binutils/

It was previously maintained by Christopher C. Chimelis <chris@debian.org>
