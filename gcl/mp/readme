README for multiprecision arithmetic directory.
README by W. Schelter

The files in this directory

gencom.h	mp.s		sparc.s
erreurs.h	genport.h	

are from the PARI distribution version 1.34 written by C. Batut, D.
Bernardi, H. Cohen and M. Olivier.

The file mp.c from the 1.34 distribution has been divided into
mpi.c:  The functions benefiting from assembler or assembler macros.
mp2.c:  Additional integer arithmetic routines.

In addition the functions in mpi.c have been somewhat rewritten by
Schelter, to improve the efficiency on machines unable to use the 68k
assembler in the pari file mp.s.  By using gcc and assembler macros,
we were able to equal the speed of the excellent pari assembler, on
multiply and addition of 100 word bignums.    This distribution
contains .s files produced by gcc for machines where this has
been available.    For other machines the functions divul3
and mulul3 may be provided as assembler functions, or they may
use the code in the libmport.a which is plain C.

mp_mulul3.c:  64 bit multiply in C
mp_divul3.c:  64 bit multiply in C
mp_bfffo.c:  position of first non zero bit in C

mpi-*.s: are assembler produced by gcc for several machines.

The integration of the pari code into AKCL was done by W. Schelter.

Thank you for the clarifications.

1) -2^31: it was mainly a matter of convenience to exclude that value, so that
in effect I don't know which programs should be affected if one allows it. If
necessary, I can look into it.

2) Yes, go ahead means that you may modify and rearrange things in your own
way,
and redistribute it, of course keeping us informed. On the other hand, please
tell us as soon as possible of any bug that you discover that we should
eliminate from the main system itself.

..

Sincerely,

Henri Cohen
