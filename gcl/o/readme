Current scheme:

All functions which used to start with siL or L have been replaced
by ones which pass arguments on the C stack.

The special forms

(eg Fprogn, Fsetq are still the same as before).

Functions in the Lisp (resp Si package) are named
fL... (respectively fS...) and they all pass arguments on the C stack and return
multiple values, and have DEFUN's which specify their argd.

eval still passes on the value stack
All functions beginning with I pass on C stack.
