{\Large{\bf New Foreword}}
\vskip .25in

On October 1, 2001 Axiom was withdrawn from the market and ended
life as a commercial product.
On September 3, 2002 Axiom was released under the Modified BSD
license, including this document.
On August 27, 2003 Axiom was released as free and open source
software available for download from the Free Software Foundation's
website, Savannah.

Work on Axiom has had the generous support of the Center for 
Algorithms and Interactive Scientific Computation (CAISS) at
City College of New York. Special thanks go to Dr. Gilbert 
Baumslag for his support of the long term goal.

The online version of this documentation is roughly 1000 pages.
In order to make printed versions we've broken it up into three
volumes. The first volume is tutorial in nature. The second volume
is for programmers. The third volume is reference material. We've
also added a fourth volume for developers. All of these changes
represent an experiment in print-on-demand delivery of documentation.
Time will tell whether the experiment succeeded.

Axiom has been in existence for over thirty years. It is estimated to
contain about three hundred man-years of research and has, as of
September 3, 2003, 143 people listed in the credits. All of these
people have contributed directly or indirectly to making Axiom
available.  Axiom is being passed to the next generation. I'm looking
forward to future milestones.

With that in mind I've introduced the theme of the ``30 year horizon''.
We must invent the tools that support the Computational Mathematician
working 30 years from now. How will research be done when every bit of
mathematical knowledge is online and instantly available? What happens
when we scale Axiom by a factor of 100, giving us 1.1 million domains?
How can we integrate theory with code? How will we integrate theorems
and proofs of the mathematics with space-time complexity proofs and
running code? What visualization tools are needed? How do we support
the conceptual structures and semantics of mathematics in effective
ways? How do we support results from the sciences? How do we teach
the next generation to be effective Computational Mathematicians?

The ``30 year horizon'' is much nearer than it appears.
