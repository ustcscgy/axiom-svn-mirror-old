#  Make sure you have the most up to date version of gnu make :

     $ make --version
     GNU Make 3.80

   If not, then upgrade your version of make or linux first.

# Install the Java development kit JDK:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp

It may be necessary to adjust symbolic links or the PATH to point to the correct version of java:

     $ ls -l `which java`
     lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 30 Jun  3 22:00 /usr/bin/java -> /usr/java/jre1.5.0_06/bin/java
     $ javac -version
     $ javac 1.5.0_06 >=

# Download and install Aldor as described here:

http://www.aldor.org

Be sure to set ALDORROOT and the PATH to Aldor properly for your system.


# Build the Aldor interface

Issue the following commands:

     $ document Makefile.pamphlet
	 $ make

 make stops with an error message. The next two steps correct the problem:

	$ touch ../../int/aldor/dep_spad.stamp
	$ document Make.functions.pamphlet

Now complete build of the Aldor interface:

    $ make 2>&1 | tee aldor.log

The build might take up to 2 hours or some machines.
